It was common in my penetration test project but i often forget about these commands so i'm thinking to writing it here.

Here we go

# Service Detection!

```
root@b0x:~# nmap -p- -sV -vv -T4 -Pn -oN outputs.txt 123.45.67.89
```

- `-p-` - Scans all ports 1-65535 
- `-Pn` - Treat all hosts as online
- `-sV` - Basic CPE/service/version detection
- `-vv` - Verbose and verbose!
- `-oN` - Save outputs (plain-text) to file
- `-T4` - Timing template (higher is faster) but i prefer 4 for no reason xD
